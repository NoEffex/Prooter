# Prooter
An application to scan through HTML posts to locate data about users and output its findings.
The intent is to quickly and easily find users, their usernames, and posts they have made.
Future enhancements will include further investigation of users across the web.

## Usage
Place the files you wish to scan through in the data/ directory. Then simply run prooter.py.
Two files will be written as a result-- user results and post results. The former has a unique list of users, and the
latter has all the content posted and who posted it. This includes post replies.
